This app is an inventory database that allows you to make purchases within node.

You will be provided a list of items, type in the ID of whatever item it is that you would like to purchase.

Following that the system will ask you what amount of that item you want to purchase. If it is in stock it will complete the purchase, if not, the inventory will be reloaded.
